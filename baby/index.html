        <p>Since we can't be together to celebrate today, let's shower baby Waddell in a different way.</p>
        <h3>On July 25th, join us for one or both!</h3>
        <p>From 10am - 11am: We will be hosting a social distanced swing-by. Please let the hosts know if you will be attending so that we have enough grab and go treats for all.</p>
        <p>From 1pm - 2:30pm: We will be hosting a Virtual Baby Shower honoring Baby Waddell and his parents. Click on the Zoom tab for more details.</p>
        <p>Feel free to reach out to Katie at (insert email later) for any questions.</p>
